# Theme Design: auto-dev-integration\n\n## Goal\nCreate AGENTS.md to provide Claude Code with project-specific instructions and the mandatory PR workflow. This ensures all future auto-dev executions follow consistent quality standards.\n\n## Context\nAGENTS.md is the primary instruction document that Claude Code reads before starting work. It must clearly communicate:\n- What this project is\n- How to make changes (PR workflow)\n- What quality standards to meet\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n- Single AGENTS.md at project root (standard location)\n- Conventional commits for message format\n- Squash merge as preferred merge strategy\n\n## Dependencies\n- Depends on Theme 01 completing (needs to reference actual scripts and structure)\n\n## Feature Sequence\n1. `001-agents-md` - Create the AGENTS.md file\n\n## Success Criteria\n- AGENTS.md exists and is readable\n- Future Claude Code sessions can follow the documented workflow
