Executed all 3 remediation actions from the v004 retrospective proposals document. Two immediate fixes were applied directly (requirements.md cross-reference correction and C4 documentation version label update). The third action (BL-038 closure decision) is a user-review item that has been documented for the user to decide.

## Remediation Actions

| # | Action | Type | Status | Notes |
|---|--------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Fix `first()` requirements.md backlog cross-reference: BL-018 → BL-020 | Immediate Fix | Done | `comms/inbox/versions/execution/v004/01-01-array-basics/001-001-first/requirements.md` line 11 updated |
| 2 | Fix C4 documentation version label: v003 → v004 | Immediate Fix | Done | `docs/C4-Documentation/README.md` line 4 updated |
| 3 | BL-038 closure decision — determine if C4 docs satisfy "initial architecture documentation" | User Review | Pending user decision | C4 documentation exists at `docs/C4-Documentation/`. User must decide: close BL-038 (C4 docs are sufficient) or narrow scope (e.g., add a simpler `ARCHITECTURE.md` overview) |
