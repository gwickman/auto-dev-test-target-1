Identified 3 personas, documented 6 system features, and created 4 user journeys for auto-dev-test-target-1 — a TypeScript utility library providing string, number, and array manipulation with typed error handling.

- **System Purpose:** A zero-dependency TypeScript utility library that provides string, number, and array manipulation functions with a built-in typed error framework for safe input validation.
- **Personas Identified:** 3
  - Application Developer (imports and uses the library)
  - Library Maintainer (develops and maintains the codebase)
  - GitHub Actions CI (automated build and test pipeline)
- **Features Documented:** 6
  - String Manipulation (capitalize, reverse, slugify, truncate)
  - Number Operations (clamp, roundTo)
  - Array Utilities (first, last, unique, chunk, compact, flatten, intersection)
  - Input Validation (type guards and assertion functions)
  - Typed Error Handling (ValidationError hierarchy)
  - Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions build + test)
