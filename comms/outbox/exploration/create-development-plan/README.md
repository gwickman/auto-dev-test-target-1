# Development Plan Created

## Overview

Successfully created a comprehensive development plan for auto-dev-test-target-1, documenting completed work and planning 3 future versions with 20 backlog items across 6 themes.

## What Was Created

### 1. docs/auto-dev/PLAN.md

Complete development plan document including:
- Project overview and technology stack
- **3 completed versions** documented (v001, v002, v003)
- **3 planned versions** designed (v004, v005, v006)
- Version mapping and development principles
- Quality standards and next steps

### 2. Backlog Items

Created **20 backlog items** organized across 3 versions:

#### v004 - Array Utilities (7 items)
**Theme: 01-array-basics**
- BL-018: unique() - Remove duplicate values
- BL-019: chunk() - Split array into chunks
- BL-020: first() - Get first element safely
- BL-021: last() - Get last element safely

**Theme: 02-array-advanced**
- BL-022: flatten() - Flatten nested arrays
- BL-023: compact() - Remove falsy values
- BL-024: intersection() - Find common elements

#### v005 - Object Utilities (7 items)
**Theme: 01-object-basics**
- BL-025: pick() - Select object properties
- BL-026: omit() - Exclude object properties
- BL-027: isEmpty() - Check if value is empty
- BL-028: keys() - Get typed object keys

**Theme: 02-object-deep**
- BL-029: merge() - Deep merge objects
- BL-030: clone() - Deep copy objects
- BL-031: get() - Safely retrieve nested properties

#### v006 - Async Utilities (6 items)
**Theme: 01-promise-utils**
- BL-032: sleep() - Promise-based delay
- BL-033: retry() - Retry failed async operations
- BL-034: timeout() - Add timeout to promises

**Theme: 02-function-utils**
- BL-035: debounce() - Delay function execution
- BL-036: throttle() - Limit function call rate
- BL-037: once() - Execute function only once

## Key Features

- **Incremental Complexity:** Each version builds naturally on previous work
- **TypeScript Focus:** Progressive challenges (generics, async, deep types)
- **Simple Features:** Appropriate for a test target (trivial implementations)
- **Complete Documentation:** All backlog items have descriptions and acceptance criteria
- **Coherent Themes:** Related features grouped logically

## Documents in This Exploration

- **README.md** (this file): Summary of what was created
- **analysis.md**: Analysis of existing versions and planning approach
- **docs/auto-dev/PLAN.md**: THE ACTUAL PLAN FILE (in project root)

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the development plan
2. Begin v004 design phase using auto-dev process
3. Generate VERSION_DESIGN.md and THEME_INDEX.md for v004
4. Execute v004 implementation following established workflow
