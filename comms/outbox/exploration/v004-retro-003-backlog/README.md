# Exploration: v004-retro-003-backlog

Post-v004 retrospective backlog verification task.

## What Was Produced

This exploration cross-referenced all backlog items planned for v004 (Array Utilities) against feature requirements and verified their completion status.

### Artifacts

| File | Location | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| README.md | `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v004/003-backlog/README.md` | Backlog verification summary with hygiene observations |
| backlog-report.md | `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v004/003-backlog/backlog-report.md` | Detailed verification table with cross-reference sources |

## Key Findings

- **7 backlog items** verified (BL-018 through BL-024)
- **All 7 already completed** — no items needed closing by this task
- **0 orphaned items** — no open items reference v004
- **0 unplanned items** — all requirements references map to PLAN.md entries
- **1 minor discrepancy** — Feature 001-001-first references BL-018 in requirements.md instead of BL-020 (no functional impact)

## Hygiene Summary

- **Staleness:** 0 stale items (all open items < 2 weeks old)
- **Orphaned tags:** `v004`, `array-basics`, `array-advanced` (expected — version complete)
- **Size calibration:** All 7 items sized M; reasonable calibration for single-function utilities with tests
