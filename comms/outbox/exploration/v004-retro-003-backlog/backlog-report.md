## Notes

- BL-018 is referenced by two features: `001-001-first` and `003-003-unique`. The `first` feature requirements reference BL-018 ("Add first() array utility") while the `unique` feature requirements also reference BL-018 ("Add unique() array utility"). The backlog item title is "Add unique() array utility" which aligns with the `unique` feature. The `first` feature may have an incorrect backlog reference (there is no separate BL item for first()).
