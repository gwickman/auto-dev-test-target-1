# Exploration: v004-retro-009-project

Task 009 (Project-Specific Closure) completed for version v004.

## What Was Produced

- **`comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v004/009-project-closure/README.md`** — Project-specific closure evaluation report

## Summary

Evaluated 7 closure areas (prompt templates, MCP tools, configuration schemas, shared utilities, project indexes, cross-project tooling, architecture documentation) against the actual v004 changes (7 array utility functions, 1 validation extension, 60 new tests). No project-specific closure needs were identified. VERSION_CLOSURE.md was absent; evaluation was based on the version's actual changes. v004 was a clean, additive version with all documentation updates already handled by prior retrospective tasks.
