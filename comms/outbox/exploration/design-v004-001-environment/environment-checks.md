**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-05T21:45:08.381877+00:00

### Overall Status
- Success: `true`
- Status: `healthy`
- Version: `6.0.0`
- Uptime: 19,699 seconds (~5.5 hours)

### Services Status

- Status: Operational

**GitHub CLI (gh):**
- Available: ✅ `true`
- Authenticated: ✅ `true`
- Path: `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.EXE`
- Status: Operational

### Execution Configuration
- Backend mode: `legacy`
- Tool key requirement: `enabled`
- Active tool keys: 2
- Static test keys configured: 0
- Orphaned keys: 0 (none)

### Security Status
- Tool key requirement: ✅ Enabled
- Authorization enforcement: ✅ Active
- Warnings: None

### Capabilities
- Manifest version: `1.1.0`
- Expected tool count: 54
- All critical tools verified present:
  - `health_check`, `list_projects`, `get_project_info`
  - `design_version`, `design_theme`
  - `start_version_execution`, `get_theme_status`
  - `list_backlog_items`, `commit_changes`

**Assessment:** ✅ MCP server is fully operational with no issues.

## Project Configuration Check

**Endpoint:** `get_project_info(project="auto-dev-test-target-1")`
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

### Project Details
- **Name:** `auto-dev-test-target-1`
- **Path:** `C:/Users/grant/Documents/projects/auto-dev-test-target-1`
- **Description:** A minimal TypeScript utility library with Jest tests and GitHub Actions CI, designed as a disposable target for auto-dev-mcp integration testing.

### Project Flags
- **Destructive test target:** ✅ `true`
  - Indicates this is a safe testing environment
  - Automated operations are authorized
  - Data loss is acceptable (test project)

### Execution State
- **Active theme:** `null` (no theme currently executing)
- **Completed themes:** `[]` (empty array)
- **Theme count:** `0`

**Note:** The 0 completed themes count refers to the current execution context. Previous versions (v001-v003) were completed but are tracked separately in version history.

### Configuration
- **Timeout:** 60.0 minutes per theme execution
- **Execution backend:** `legacy` mode

**Assessment:** ✅ Project is properly configured and ready for new version design. No active execution blocking new work.

## Git Status Check

**Endpoint:** `git_read(project="auto-dev-test-target-1", operation="status")`
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

### Branch Information
- **Current branch:** `main`
- **Remote tracking:** `origin/main`
- **Ahead of remote:** 0 commits
- **Behind remote:** 0 commits
- **Status:** Up to date with remote

### Working Tree Status
- **Is clean:** `false` (1 modified file)
- **Repository path:** `C:\Users\grant\Documents\projects\auto-dev-test-target-1`
- **Repository URL:** `https://github.com/gwickman/auto-dev-test-target-1.git`

### File Counts
- **Modified files:** 1
- **Staged files:** 0
- **Untracked files:** 0

### Modified Files Detail
1. `comms/state/explorations/design-v004-001-environment-1770327891185.json`
   - Path indicates this is an exploration state tracking file
   - Generated by the current exploration task
   - Safe to ignore for version design purposes

### Assessment
**Working tree status:** ✅ Acceptable for design work

The single modified file is an exploration state tracker created by the MCP server to track this exploration's progress. It does not represent uncommitted code changes or pending work that would block version design.

**Recommendations:**
- Proceed with design tasks
- The exploration commit at the end will include this state file
- No need to stash or commit separately before continuing
