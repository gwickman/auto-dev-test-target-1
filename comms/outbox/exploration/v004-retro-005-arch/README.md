# Exploration: v004 Retrospective - Architecture Alignment (Task 005)

Completed architecture alignment check for v004. No drift detected — the existing C4 documentation already accurately reflects all v004 changes.

## Artifacts Produced

- `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v004/005-architecture/README.md` — Full architecture alignment report with drift assessment, documentation status, and codebase verification

## Summary

- **Existing open item**: BL-038 ("Create initial architecture documentation") — updated notes to reflect C4 docs now exist
- **v004 changes**: 7 array utility functions, 1 new validator, barrel export updates
- **C4 documentation**: Comprehensive docs exist at `docs/C4-Documentation/` (21 files), already covering all v004 content
- **Drift**: None detected. All v004 changes are accurately documented in the C4 docs
- **Action**: Updated BL-038 notes; no new backlog item needed
