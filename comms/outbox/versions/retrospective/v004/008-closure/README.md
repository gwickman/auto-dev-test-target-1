# Task 008: Generic Closure — v004

Closure completed with **3 documents updated, 1 backlog item created, repository verified clean**.

## Plan.md

**Updated.** Changes made:
- Roadmap table: v004 status changed from `planned` to `completed`
- v004 section moved from "Planned Versions" to "Completed Versions" with full completion details
- Added completion date (February 6, 2026), duration (~95 minutes), theme checkmarks
- Added retrospective link, key learnings, backlog created reference
- Updated "Last Updated" to February 6, 2026
- Added change log entry

## CHANGELOG

**Verified complete.** The `[v004] - 2026-02-06` section in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` contains:
- Added: All 7 array utility functions with signatures, isNonNegativeInteger() validator, 60 new tests
- Changed: Extended validation module, updated src/index.ts exports
- Fixed: N/A noted (new features only)

No changes needed — CHANGELOG was properly maintained during version execution.

## README

**No changes needed.** The root `README.md` is minimal (`[Alpha] simple test target repo - not production ready`) which is appropriate for a test target project. The array utilities don't change the project's fundamental description.

## Repository

**Clean** with one expected exception:
- Branch: `main`, up to date with remote
- Working tree: Modified files from this retrospective (expected)
- Open PRs: None
- Stale branches: 4 remote branches from v002 (documented in Task 001, flagged for user cleanup in Task 007 proposals)
