# Task 006: Learning Extraction — v004

7 new learnings saved (LRN-006 through LRN-012), 0 existing learnings reinforced. All learnings extracted from v004 completion reports, theme retrospectives, and the version retrospective.

## New Learnings

| ID | Title | Tags | Source |
|----|-------|------|--------|
| LRN-006 | Simple-to-Complex Feature Ordering Reduces Theme Execution Risk | pattern, process, theme-design, risk-reduction | v004 version retro + both theme retros |
| LRN-007 | Validation-at-Boundary Pattern for Numeric Parameters | pattern, validation, typescript, api-design | v004 version retro + both theme retros |
| LRN-008 | Validation Module Extensibility Through Focused Validators | pattern, validation, extensibility, module-design | chunk + flatten completion reports + version retro |
| LRN-009 | TypeScript filter(Boolean) Requires Type Assertion Workaround | pattern, typescript, type-system, workaround | compact completion report + Theme 02 retro |
| LRN-010 | Handle Infinity Before Integer Validation for Numeric Parameters | pattern, validation, edge-case, api-design | flatten completion report + Theme 02 retro |
| LRN-011 | Comprehensive Edge Case Testing for JavaScript-Specific Quirks | pattern, testing, javascript, edge-cases | Theme 01 retro + Theme 02 retro |
| LRN-012 | Module-per-Domain with Barrel Exports Scales for Utility Libraries | pattern, module-design, architecture, scalability | version retro + Theme 01 retro |

## Reinforced Learnings

No existing learnings (LRN-001 through LRN-005) were reinforced. The existing learnings cover MCP tool testing topics with no overlap to v004's array utility development patterns.

## Filtered Out

- **5 items filtered as duplicates**: Cross-theme observations that appeared in multiple retrospectives were consolidated into single learnings (e.g., simple-to-complex ordering appeared in both theme retros and the version retro — saved once as LRN-006).
- **3 items filtered as too implementation-specific**: O(1) accessor vs O(n) transformation categorization, variadic rest parameter usage, and recursive reduce pattern — these are implementation details of specific functions rather than transferable insights.
- **2 items filtered as version-specific**: Test count tracking (65 → 93 → 131) and C4 documentation skip — these are v004 status observations, not generalizable learnings.
- **0 causal claims rejected**: No unverified root-cause narratives were found in the source documents.
