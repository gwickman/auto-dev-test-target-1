# Task 006: Learning Extraction — v004

Learning extraction identified **6 new transferable learnings** from v004 completion reports and retrospectives. 0 existing learnings reinforced (no prior learnings exist in the system).

## New Learnings

| # | Title | Tags | Source |
|---|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Simple-to-complex feature ordering reduces risk | pattern, process | v004 version retrospective |
| 2 | Module-per-domain structure scales cleanly | pattern, architecture | v004/01-array-basics retrospective |
| 3 | Validate external inputs, trust typed structural inputs | pattern, validation | v004/01-array-basics retrospective |
| 4 | TypeScript filter(Boolean) requires type assertion | debugging, typescript | v004/02-array-advanced/compact completion-report |
| 5 | Recursive depth pattern for nested structures | pattern, algorithm | v004/02-array-advanced/flatten completion-report |
| 6 | Variadic rest parameters with generics for multi-input APIs | pattern, typescript | v004/02-array-advanced/intersection completion-report |

## Reinforced Learnings

None — no existing learnings in the system to reinforce. This is the first retrospective to extract learnings.

## Filtered Out

- **4 items filtered as too implementation-specific:** Specific file paths, exact function signatures, and code snippets that don't generalize
- **2 items filtered as duplicates:** Barrel export pattern (subset of module-per-domain), feature independence (subset of simple-to-complex ordering)

## Notes

Learnings could not be saved via `save_learning()` MCP tool due to connectivity issues. The 6 learnings above are documented here and in `learnings-detail.md` for manual saving or remediation-phase saving.
