# Task 001: Environment Verification — v004

Environment is **READY** for retrospective execution. All checks pass with one minor note: working tree has one modified state file (exploration tracking) which is expected during retrospective execution.

## Health Check

**Status:** Pass

MCP server is running and responsive. Project `auto-dev-test-target-1` is registered and accessible.

## Git Status

**Status:** Pass (with note)

- **Branch:** `main`
- **Remote sync:** Up to date with `origin/main`
- **Working tree:** One modified file: `comms/state/explorations/v004-retrospective-1770399515520.json` (expected — this is the active retrospective exploration state file)
- **Staged changes:** None

## Open PRs

**Status:** None

No open pull requests exist. All v004 PRs (#16–#22) have been merged.

## Version Status

**Status:** Pass — v004 completed

- **Version:** v004
- **Status:** `completed`
- **Started:** 2026-02-06T10:43:47Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-06T12:18:42Z
- **Theme 01 (01-array-basics):** completed — 4/4 features
- **Theme 02 (02-array-advanced):** completed — 3/3 features
- **Total features:** 7/7 completed

## Stale Branches

**Status:** 4 stale remote branches from v002 (not v004)

Remote branches found:
- `remotes/origin/v002/01-string-utils/002-truncate`
- `remotes/origin/v002/01-string-utils/003-slugify`
- `remotes/origin/v002/02-number-utils/001-clamp`
- `remotes/origin/v002/02-number-utils/002-round-to`

These are leftover from v002 execution, not v004. No v004 stale branches exist.

## Blockers

**None.** Environment is ready for retrospective continuation.
