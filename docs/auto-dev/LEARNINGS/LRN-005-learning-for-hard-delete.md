# Test Learning for Hard Delete

This learning is created to test the hard delete functionality of the delete_learning tool.

## Key Points
- This should be completely removed
- Content file should be deleted from disk
- Should not be retrievable with get_learning

## Expected Behavior
When hard deleted, both the learning metadata and the content file should be completely removed from the system.
